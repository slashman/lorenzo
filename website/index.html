	<p><b>#StopBullfighting</b></p>
	<p>On July 9 2016 Lorenzo jumped into the Bullring of Teruel, Spain. He was the third bull of the day: Listillo and Clavero had already died at the hands of matadores Curro Diaz and Morenito de Aranda. Victor Barrios, a bullfighter from Segovia, died that day after Lorenzo rammed a horn through his chest.</p>
	<p>Lorenzo was sacrificed shortly afterwards, and his mother Lorenza may have been slaughtered too as part of a tradition to end the lineage of the "Killer Bull", but she had reportedly been killed already weeks before, because of her old age.</p>
